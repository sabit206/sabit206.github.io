    <h2>Profile</h2> 
    <p>I am a highly self motivated individual, My goal is to help push technology and and society forward all while trying to grow my self. Technology is always changing and advancing, with the skills i hope to learn at prime academy i wish to help people adapt all while also adapting myself to the changes in the technology industry.I am interested in learning coding because it really interests me how everything on the internet we use on a daily basis comes to be, how its made and how it works. Being able to be a part of that would be a dream come true. 
</P>  
   
  <h2> Academic History</h2>
      <p>I graduated from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainier_Beach_High_School">Rainier Beach High School</a> located in Seattle,WA class of 2015. I also went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Center_Senior_High_School">Park Center High School</a> , during my time there i took a web design class that opend the door for me to the programing world witch made me realize this is what i wanted to do. The first time i tried coding , to say it was a challenge would be an understatement but with some studying and practicing it became much easier and fun. I believe Seeing your code finally come together and work after many roadblocks and problem solving  is what makes coding so fun a awarding.
